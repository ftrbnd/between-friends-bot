got a couple bags 
gonna go away and stay there for a while 
the cars don’t go as fast 
now I’m older like i capped the speed dial 
took a wind blow like a face lift 
kept a tight lace running through your braces  
crashed the rental
 lost my mental 
swimming in the moonlight 
hopefully we’re alright 

oh
lights flashing and I’m gushing every time 
but 
it’s you that’s on my mind 
and you can tell i really wanna stay but i can’t sit still 
and you can tell i really wanna stay but i can’t sit still 

got a couple jobs 
but I’m making all my money on the side 
lifted on sobriety 
a solo hit wonder on the ride 
took a nice dip to the pavement
lay my head down staring into spaces 
crashed the rental 
lost my mental 
swimming in the moonlight 
hopefully we’re alright 


oh
lights flashing and I’m gushing every time 
but 
it’s you that’s on my mind 
and you can tell i really wanna stay but i can’t sit still 
and you can tell i really wanna stay but i can’t sit still
