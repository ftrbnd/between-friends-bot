how many days can it be like this
i play you in my head
am i something  you'll miss
but now i’m in the way
counting your days
hope to be the last one you call when it's late
holding my breath 
when i see you look away
hoping for the best cause i know you’re doing great
but now i'm in the way 
counting your days 
hope to be the last one you call when its late
