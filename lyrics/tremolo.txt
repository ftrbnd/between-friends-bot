guess i'm out of luck
i'm a tremolo 
make my heart sway back while i'm moving slow
guess i'm out of love 
it's a tremolo 
make my heart beat fast 

you could hide your eyes 
fill the gaps between 
i got u in the back so we won't be seen 
i guess im out of love its a tremolo 
Make my heart beat fast 

don't you mind
i've been stuck online
out of time
tell me to unwind 
don't you mind 
twisted up all night 
out of line 
are we out of time? 

guess i'm out of luck
i'm a tremolo 
make my heart sway back while i'm moving slow
guess i'm out of love 
it's a tremolo 
make my heart beat fast
