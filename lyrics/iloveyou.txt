weekend
You light my fire like a cigarette
I see your colors
Never forget me
Travel wild
Making our own streets
hard stop
And I feel it even more, how?
Our hands are cold
Are you sure now?
hot box
quiet talks
swimming pools at night
Our skin sweet, incomplete
but you know what I liked
I love you, tenderly
tragically
I love you, tenderly
tragically
Slow it down
Your eyes are fading
Turn up the sound
We used to run all night
never come down
we trace through the seams your new car seat
hard stop
and feel it even more, how?
our hands are cold
are you sure now?
hot box
quiet talks
Swimming pools at night
our skin sweet, incomplete
but you know what I liked
I love you, tenderly
tragically
I love you, tenderly
tragically
(I love you tenderly, tragically)
(I love you tenderly, tragically)
(I love you tenderly, tragically)
(I love you tenderly, tragically)
hot box
quiet talks
Swimming pools at night
our skin sweet, incomplete
but you know what I liked
I love you, tenderly
tragically
I love you, tenderly
tragically
hot box
quiet talks
Swimming pools at night
our skin sweet, incomplete
but you know what I liked
I love you, tenderly
tragically
I love you, tenderly
