we watch the city from mine 
and u like it that way 
romanticize saying bye 

u said the timing was right
and i want it that way
i watched u go it’s alright 

4 in the morning 
pick a fight just for me
let’s not be lonely
you’re on my mind
4 in the morning 
sitting on your floor 
we hate being lonely 
and i can see why 

i think i could use some more of you
i don’t know u but i really need to 

i think i could use some more of you
i don’t know u but i really need to 

told me i had to come by 
to see you again 
we watch the years take a ride
forget another goodbye 
now you’re going again
you like when i roll my eyes 

4 in the morning 
pick a fight just for me
let’s not be lonely
you’re on my mind
4 in the morning 
sitting on your floor 
we hate being lonely 
and i can see why 

i think i could use some more of you
i don’t know u but i really need to 

i think i could use some more of you
i don’t know u but i really need to 

my skin on you and it’s sweet
you are the one thing that i need 
and i can see why 

i think i could use some more of you
i don’t know u but i really need to 

i think i could use some more of you
i don’t know u but i really need to
