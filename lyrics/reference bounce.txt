i can remember everything
it lifts me heavenly
i know i loved being around

in moments i try make it stay
i pull up your name
i know some things are just not up to me
i float back down


i fall back down again
I know
means so much to me so

I float
i miss you


over
dont feel better when it's over
won't feel better when it's over 
donâ€™t feel better when it's over
won't feel better when it's over


i can remember everything
it lifts me heavenly
i know i loved being around

in moments i try make it stay
i pull up your name
i know some things are just not up to me
i float back down


what's the time?
what's your vibe?
take a bite
take a ride
