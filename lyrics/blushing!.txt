Caught a ride on a summer's day
Green lights never turned to red
I see you, am I too scared?
French kissing on your bed and
I feel so brand new when you talk like that
I feel so brand new, can you talk like that?
Won't you stay?
Our friends are faded
On a high, you're on my mind tonight
Won't you stay?
Our friends are faded
On a high, you're on my mind tonight
Shotgun and we leave the garden
Still scared and blushing
Shotgun and we leave the garden
Still scared and blushing
Drive through your neighborhood
Pink sky never looked so good
You see me like you should
I thought you never would and
I feel so brand new
When you talk like that
I feel so brand new,
Can you talk like that?
Won't you stay?
Our friends are faded
On a high, you're on my mind tonight
Won't you stay?
Our friends are faded
On a high, you're on my mind tonight
Shotgun and we leave the garden
Still scared and blushing
Shotgun and we leave the garden
Still scared and blushing
I see you, we watch stars on the pavement
I kinda like your face
I kinda like your face
I see you, we watch stars on the pavement
I kinda like your face
I kinda like your face
Won't you stay?
Our friends are faded
On a high, you're on my mind tonight
Won't you stay?
Our friends are faded
On a high, you're on my mind tonight
Shotgun and we leave the garden
Still scared and blushing
Shotgun and we leave the garden
Still scared and blushing
Shotgun
Blushing
Shotgun
Blushing
