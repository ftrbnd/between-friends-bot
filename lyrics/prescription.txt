it was getting late last night 
and i can't get you off my mind
you could always run and hide 
and i keep feeling like my hands are tied 

but you like 
you like us both 
but you never wanna decide 
you like 
you like us both 
but you never wanna decide

it was getting late last night 
i couldn't get you off my mind
we could always run a lie 
if that would mean i'd have you by my side 

but you like 
you like us both 
but you never wanna decide 
you like 
you like us both 
but you never wanna decide

your prescription 
is all that you are ever missing 
i could never fill that gap for you
i lock the cap when you're by my side 
my side

but you like 
you like us both 
but you never wanna decide 
you like 
you like us both 
but you never wanna decide

(yeah yeah yeah)
