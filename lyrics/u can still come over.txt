I can tell you all you need to hear
But I don't think you want me to
I can give you all of me
And still, you always lose your cool
I take you out
It's sad to see
You grab the light
Just wait for me
I'll be the one
The one you can keep
Yeah, but not for long
With all those fears
Taking you out
You wanna dance
So dance with me
You know that you can still
Come anytime (Every time)
You know that you
Can still come over
Naturally your habits keep me high
All the time
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
You know that you can still come anytime
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
Naturally your habits keep me high
All the time
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
You should tell me all I need to hear
But I don't really want you to
Tried to give me all of you
And still, I went in and lost my cool
I take you out
It's sad to see
You grab the light
Just wait for me
I'll be the one
The one you can keep
Yeah, but not for long
With all those fears
Taking you out
You wanna dance
So dance with me
You know that you can still
Come anytime (Every time)
You know that you
Can still come over
Naturally your habits keep me high
All the time
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
You know that you can still come anytime
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
Naturally your habits keep me high
All the time
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
You know that you can still
Come anytime (Every time)
You know that you
Can still come over
Naturally your habits keep me high
All the time
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
You know that you can still come anytime
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
Naturally your habits keep me high
All the time
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
You know that you can still
Come anytime (Every time)
You know that you
Can still come over
Naturally your habits keep me high
All the time
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
You know that you can still come anytime
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
Naturally your habits keep me high
All the time
(Every time)
You know that you can still come over
