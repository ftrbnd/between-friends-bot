taking what I know 
just off the right throw
can we keep it fun
i know that you want to

do we ever really wanna slow it down
moving with the phases 
do we know them now

leaving tomorrow that's
just what I know
never kept it fun 
thatâ€™s all that I asked 

i can tell we really wanna slow it down 
moving with the moments
and we know them now

you can tell i always had a thing for you baby 
you can tell it never went away 
can you try and take it all the way with me baby 
i got all you need and i won't fade

chasing nirvana 
i still think we wanna 
we can keep it going 
if you're calling i'll be rolling like
you can ease my mind just like a motorbike 
always saying bye and we don't know why 

you can tell i always had a thing for you baby 
you can tell it never went away 
can you try and take it all the way with me baby 
i got all you need and i won't fade

you can tell 
you can tell
