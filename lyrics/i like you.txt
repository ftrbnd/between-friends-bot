you can stay part time 
if we talk about it
you can waste my life
we can be part time
if you wanna try it
you can ride my bike

tell me what you wanna say
dont it feel much better babe
you've been stuck inside my brain
holding on for better days 
tell me what you wanna say
don’t it feel much better babe
you've been stuck inside my brain
holding on for better days 

i tried my best to block you out
i can't deny i like you now
i tried my best to block you out
i can't deny i like you now

you can stay part time 
if we talk about it
you can waste my life
we can be part time
if you wanna try it
you can ride my bike

tell me what you wanna say
dont it feel much better babe
you've been stuck inside my brain
holding on for better days 
tell me what you wanna say
don’t it feel much better babe
you've been stuck inside my brain
holding on for better days
