i can never call when I'm lonely 
tell me different things when you want me
never was the type to get lonely 
something in the way you told me 

and i could take you home but its the old me 
you tell me what i want and here we are again 
there’s nothing like the nights where you unfold me 
can we ever make it out again / again 

 i should never call when I'm lonely 
look for you in things that you show me 
never was the type to stay lonely 
something in the way you told me 

and i could take you home but its the old me 
you tell me what i want and here we are again 
there’s nothing like the nights where you unfold me 
can we ever make it out again / again 
and i could be the one to say I'm lonely 
you tell me what i want and here we are again 
there’s nothing like the nights where you unfold me 
can we ever make it out again / again 

you got blue eyes what you wanna see ? 
i’ve been down town with your friends 
you got new eyes what you wanna see ? 
i’ve been downtown 

i could be easy for your mind
its like easy love is hard to find 
baby 
what is yours is mine
