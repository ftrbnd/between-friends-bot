been thinking bout the times I tried 
to get you off my mind 
but then you ask if ill come by 
and i say yeah 
but now its been a year or three 
and you still tell your friends about me 
o0 is this long lost chemistry baby 

 i lost your number just so i won’t call again 
can’t help myself from falling should we try again 
again

but i recall you pushed the distance
been waiting just a little bit for you now i'm passed that
all i want to get is good sleep

but if i come by can we make up?
keep fucking in the day
keep a little bit of me on the table
incapable of knowing better

cos i lost your number
just so i won't call
