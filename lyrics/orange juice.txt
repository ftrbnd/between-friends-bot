got too close I’m on the edge
citrus kisses down your neck
I won’t fall
never stall
bring it back
growing tall
 
laid out on my balcony
watch the sky move from the breeze
we won’t stop
never not
falling down
take the drop
 
when i picture you my mind goes
it happens all the time though
making life divine
on a field trip to the sky 
picture you my mind goes
it happens all the time though
making life divine
on a field trip to the sky 
 
and i know you’re tired
ease your mind
time flies
ending so soon
 
waking up
orange juice
let me sip on you then somebody new
mix it up
like orange juice
in a swimming pool made for you
 
waking up
orange juice
let me sip on you then somebody new
mix it up
like orange juice
in a swimming pool made for you
  
fought the sun for time in bed
like you best with words unsaid
can we just
watch the time
slowly go
you know i’m
 
hung on this reality
sweeten up
your honey bee
take your mind
let it go
bring it back
show me more
 
when i picture you my mind goes
it happens all the time though
making life divine
on a field trip to the sky 
picture you my mind goes
it happens all the time though
making life divine
on a field trip to the sky 
 
waking up
orange juice
let me sip on you then somebody new
mix it up
like orange juice
in a swimming pool made for you
