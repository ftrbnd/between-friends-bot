tryna be the one you stay awake for 
and you know that if you ask me i would be yours 

tryna be the one you stay awake for 
and you know that if you ask me i would be yours 

overseas 
skyline like a peach
fill my hair with bleach
take a seat
lean ur head on me 

 wannabe 
highlight of your dreams
nothin comes between
what u need 
lean your head on me 

sweet n sour 
i’m holding on to u 
has it been hours 
ooo must’ve left my heart up on your counter
i like you just a little
picking flowers 
flowers 

tryna be the one you stay awake for 
and you know that if you ask me i would be yours 

tryna be the one you stay awake for 
and you know that if you ask me i would be yours 

summer heat 
tough without a breeze
you know where i’ll be 
save a seat 
lean ur head on me 

been a couple weeks 
you lost track of me 
hoping we’d agree 
what a treat
having you by me

sweet n sour 
i’m holding on to u 
has it been hours 
ooo must’ve left my heart up on your counter
i like you just a little
picking flowers 
flowers 

tryna be the one you stay awake for 
and you know that if you ask me i would be yours
