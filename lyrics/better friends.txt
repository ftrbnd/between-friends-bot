I want to roll you up and smoke you down
Won't you light up for me?
We could question time and start to climb
To the roof this morning
It's just a shame, I don't remember the things I say
If I looped my life to live again, I'd pick more roses
And pick better friends who like to sleep in daytime
Fall in love and kiss at night
With better friends
We'll try to be alright, alright
If I looped my life to live again, I'd pick more roses
And pick better friends who like to sleep in daytime
Fall in love and kiss at night
With better friends
We'll try to be alright, alright
Well, our lips are red, we're on the bed
Will you clean up with me?
What if computers care and we just stare
Through their hearts all day?
It's just a shame, I don't remember the things I say
If I looped my life to live again, I'd pick more roses
And pick better friends who like to sleep in daytime
Fall in love and kiss at night
With better friends
We'll try to be alright, alright
If I looped my life to live again, I'd pick more roses
And pick better friends who like to sleep in daytime
Fall in love and kiss at night
With better friends
We'll try to be alright, alright
We are sleep-deprived, San Francisco
We lost track of time on the pillow
Think of all the cash that we still owe, you and I
We are sleep-deprived, San Francisco
We lost track of time on the pillow

If I looped my life to live again, I'd pick more roses
And pick better friends who like to sleep in daytime

With better friends
We'll try to be alright, alright
If I looped my life to live again, I'd pick more roses
And pick better friends who like to sleep in daytime
