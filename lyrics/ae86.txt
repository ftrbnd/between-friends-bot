any way you like it 
baby we can fall in place 
any way you lock it 
i can tell you needed space

never got to see you on the way home
you've been falling out of line and you won't say so
how do i get in situations?
do you know you set me back a couple days

any way you like it 
baby we can fall in place 
any way you lock it 
i can tell you needed space

can we call it californiacation 
we can wrap it up and feel it when weâ€™re all alone
never been the kind to celebrate but
do you know you set me back a couple days
