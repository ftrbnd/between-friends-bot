whenever you’re free
call your baby
whenever you like
you can stay the night

whenever you’re free
call your baby
whenever you like
you can stay the night

tell me when the sun is shining babe
i don’t wanna leave you contemplating
show me when there’s nothing else to say
i don’t wanna leave you contemplating
