daydreaming and i'm thinking of you
daydreaming and i'm thinking of you
daydreaming and iâ€™m thinking of you
daydreaming and i'm thinking of you
look at my mind floating away

he's the kind of guy that would say
hey, baby let's get away
let's go some place, huh
where I don't care
he's the kind of guy that you give your everything
you trust your heart, share all of your love
till death do you part
i want to be what he wants
when he wants it and whenever he needs it
and when he's lonesome and feeling love starved
i'll be there to feed it
i'm loving' him a little bit more each day
turns me right on when I hear him say

hey, baby, let's get away
let's go somewhere far
baby can we
where, i don't care
hey baby let's get away
let's go somewhere far
baby can we
where, i don't care
