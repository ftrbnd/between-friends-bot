with every passing moment
thoughts of you run through my head
every time that i'm near you
i realize that you're heaven sent (yeah)


i think you're truly something special
just what my dreams are really made of
let's stay together you and me, boy
there's no one like you around (yeah)


i really like what you've done to me
i can't really explain it, i am so into you
really like what you've done to me
i can't really explain it, i'm so into ya


it could be the way that you hold me
could be the things that you say (that you say)
oh, i'm not too sure what it is, boy
but, i know, i like feeling this way


i think you're truly something special
just what my dreams are really made of
let's stay together you and me, boy (boy)
there's no one like you around (yeah)
