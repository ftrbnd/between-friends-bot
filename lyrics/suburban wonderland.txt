are you looking for drugs?
just for a little thrill
are you looking for love?
my body can be your pill
eyes looking for a touch
i'll always take a few
hands looking to clutch
but your high's already real


empty bottles on the pavement
try to find a way
i'll, I'll take you there
i'll take you there
and these never ending days
searching for a way
i'll, I'll take you there
i'll take you there


we always seems to come back
we always seem to come back down
but I'm floating with you
every time you come around
we always seem to get back
we always seem to get back up
and the lights are bright here
and it's easy for us to get
it's our suburban wonderland
never need a helping hand
days and nights they always change
but you and I just stay the same
it's our suburban wonderland
never need a helping hand
days and nights they always change
but you and I just stay the same


i'm not looking for drugs
just for a little thrill
i'm looking for your love
your body can be my pill
