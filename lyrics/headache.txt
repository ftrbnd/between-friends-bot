staring at the ceiling 
starting to think you'll never leave 
and i can't relate to 
anything you say to me

cause my head is aching 
i don't want your conversations 
you can't say 
didn't mean to 
get into this situation
i can't seem to get away 
my head aches 

real talk is so hard 
why you talking so much
why you talking so much
why you talking so much 
real talk is so hard 
why you talking so much
why you talking so much
why you talking so much 

never said my name but you seem to remember me 
cellophane your t-shirt 
now your breathing heavily 

cause my head is aching 
i don't want your conversations 
you can't say 
didn't mean to 
get into this situation
i can't seem to get away 
my head aches 

real talk is so hard 
why you talking so much
why you talking so much
why you talking so much 
real talk is so hard 
why you talking so much
why you talking so much
why you talking so much
