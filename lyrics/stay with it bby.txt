you like to talk when we take a ride 
say it’s sweet to you
 i like the street lights 
and the way the red shines 
right on to you
and ill just take your time 
take in the street lights
i just take your time then i waste it 
i just take your time 
head for the street lights 
i just take your time till your wasted 

 cause i’ve been spending all my love 
i’ve been spending all my love 
you know that I’ve been spending all my love on you [stay with it bby]
