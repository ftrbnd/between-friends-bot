i’ve been down for a minute or two  
lost my mind but i’m feelin brand new  
star struck eyes but you don’t have a clue  
gold teeth shine when i’m lookin at you  
 
growing tall enough  
to get involved  
but now  
i’m high and stuck here  
always told myself that i’d be fine  
if i stayed up in my mind 
conversations all the time  
 
growing tall enough  
to get involved  
but now  
i’m high and stuck here  
always told myself that i’d be fine  
if i stayed up in my mind 
conversations all the time  
 
 
did we fall just a little too soon 
do you try all alone in your room  
check your eyes make the red turn to blue  
gold teeth shine when i’m looking at you  
 
growing tall enough  
to get involved  
but now  
i’m high and stuck here  
always told myself that i’d be fine  
if i stayed up in my mind 
conversations all the time  
 
growing tall enough  
to get involved  
but now  
i’m high and stuck here  
always told myself that i’d be fine  
if i stayed up in my mind 
conversations all the time
