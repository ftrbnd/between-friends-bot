you try feeling what you say 
kinda like it 
maybe you could stay 
no one makes me feel this way
save it for a lonely day 

cause im fucking with you
stuck in a daze 
does time move only one pace 
my heart racing 
i'm just rephrasing 

i think we should stay up
can we stay the same you
really never leave my brain
i wanna make you feel the same 
ok
we stay up 
can we stay the same you
really never leave my brain
i wanna make you feel the same 
ok

you like holding me to things
know I'm trying 
like me in that way 
I can't be the one to say
take it put my mind in place 

cause i'm falling down
flat on my face 
does time move only one pace 
my heart racing 
iâ€™m just rephrasing 

i think we should stay up
can we stay the same you
really never leave my brain
i wanna make you feel the same 
ok
we stay up 
can we stay the same you
really never leave my brain
i wanna make you feel the same 
ok
we stay up 
can we stay the same 
never really leave my brain
wanna make you feel the same 

i think we should stay up
can we stay the same you
really never leave my brain
i wanna make you feel the same
